# Research Paper Notes
Initiative to read research papers at [IvLabs](http://www.ivlabs.in/)

## Rules of appending papers:
1. You should thoroughly read research paper and make proper notes using [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/).
1. HackMD notes must mention those member who were part of reading group.
1. If notes and paper reading is completed, then update the details in the appropriate table below.
1. You can then create pull request to merge this.
1. If anyone feels that there are changes required in HackMD notes, Please add comments in the note ([How to add comments](https://hackmd.io/s/how-to-use-comments)).
1. These comments will be reviewed and proper actions will be taken by authors.
